# Education-Inequality-in-Pakistan-Analysis
🎯 **Objective**

The purpose of this project is to analyze education inequality across the provinces of Pakistan by comparing access, gender parity, and learning outcomes. Using datasets from Pakistan Education Statistics (PES), Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) surveys, and ASER Pakistan, the project builds an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights disparities in enrollment, literacy, and gender balance. The goal is to produce a data-driven snapshot of education equity that is both policy-relevant and portfolio-ready.

❓**Research Questions**

How do enrollment rates vary across provinces?
To what extent does gender parity in education differ regionally?
Are higher enrollment rates translating into improved learning outcomes?
Which provinces exhibit the widest gaps between educational access and learning quality?
What systemic factors contribute to these disparities?

📂 **Data Sources**

Pakistan Education Statistics (PES) – Enrollment, schools, and teachers (AEPAM/PIE).
Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) Survey – Literacy and attendance indicators (PBS).
ASER Pakistan Reports – Independent learning outcome assessments.
Supplementary datasets: PBS, World Bank EdStats, Open Data Portals.

🛠️ **Methodology**

Data Collection: Extracted provincial-level indicators from PES, PSLM, and ASER.
Data Preparation: Cleaned and standardized datasets using Power Query; calculated Gender Parity Index (GPI), teacher–student ratios, and composite Education Equity Index.
Analysis: Conducted comparative analysis using descriptive statistics and ratio measures; normalized indicators for cross-province comparisons.
Visualization: Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:
Choropleth map (Education Equity Index by province)
Bar charts and scatter plots (enrollment vs learning outcomes)
KPI cards for national benchmarks and provincial outliers
Drilldowns and tooltips for interactive storytelling
Validation: Cross-checked computed metrics with published official statistics.

🔑 **Key Insights**

Enrollment gains are not always matched by improvements in learning outcomes.
Gender disparities persist, with certain provinces showing significant gaps in female participation.
Teacher–student ratios and literacy outcomes vary widely across provinces, reflecting unequal resource distribution.
Addressing inequality requires focusing on both access and quality.

✅ **Conclusion & Recommendations**

Conclusion: Provincial disparities highlight that while access to education has expanded, learning outcomes remain inconsistent, pointing to systemic quality gaps.
Recommendations:
Prioritize foundational learning outcomes alongside enrollment.
Strengthen gender equity interventions in underperforming provinces.
Improve teacher capacity and address classroom resource constraints.
Design localized, province-specific policy solutions.
Institutionalize regular monitoring by combining administrative data (PES/PSLM) with independent surveys (ASER).
